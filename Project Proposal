•	Project Summary
1.) Project Background
A lot of applications require large quantities of natural looking motion. Unfortunately, a lot of expertise is required to generate natural looking motions, even when proper physical modelling is applied to the character. A common solution to this problem is to capture motion data, and then derive a reconstructed skeleton model. However, capturing data suffers from two main issues. First, it is an expensive process. Second, it requires a lot of effort to generate data that fits application constraints.
2.) Project Objectives
•	Objective 1
Our group will develop a 3D motion generator which is able to generate smooth transitions between any random poses automatically.
•	Objective 2
The motion generator will be able to regulate generated motions to give smooth and natural looking motions.
•	Objective 3
The motion generator allows customization by running script-like programming that specifies the goal of the motion and leaves the generation of the low-level instructions to the system.
•	Project Methodology
1.) The Project Approach Summary
The first two goals are to synthesize smooth and natural looking motion data that meets several constraints. We plan on achieving that by performing two steps: first, based on natural motion data from the motion library (CMU), basic motion tracks will be generated automatically by the mathematical method (SLERP) for each joint in BVH file. Simultaneously, anatomical joint limits (degree of freedom, DOF) will be applied on the generated motions to guarantee natural looking. For customization, we plan to build a motion database, script reader, and a standardized script format which allows of efficient script reading and invoking corresponding motions from database.
